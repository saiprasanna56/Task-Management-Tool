During the development of this project, I gained a deep understanding of several key technologies and practices in full-stack development:

Docker: Prior to this project, I had no experience with Docker. Through this task, I learned how to containerize both the frontend and backend, set up Docker Compose, and run services in isolated environments, which will be incredibly useful for future deployments.

API Design and Management: I improved my skills in designing and organizing APIs. I learned how to structure backend routes, controllers, and middleware for better scalability and maintainability.

PostgreSQL: This project was my introduction to PostgreSQL. I became familiar with writing basic SQL queries, setting up relational schemas, and interacting with the database using Node.js and SQL clients.

React: Through this project, I also significantly improved my skills in React. I learned better state management, component structuring, and how to integrate frontend components with backend APIs efficiently.

Postman API Testing: I also learned how to test APIs effectively using Postman. This helped me validate the correctness of my API endpoints, debug responses, and ensure that the backend is functioning as expected.

Overall, this project pushed me to explore new tools and best practices. It helped me bridge gaps in my full-stack knowledge and has definitely made me more confident in building scalable and production-ready web applications.
